# Prepare SQL Server 2016 prerequisites - Azure SQL Managed Instance link
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This article teaches you how to enable Always On with Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) on your SQL Server 2016 as an extra step to [prepare your environment](managed-instance-link-preparation.md) for Managed Instance link.

Extra steps described in this guide are mandatory for SQL Server 2016 only, as this version of SQL Server can't enable Always On option without Windows Server Failover Cluster present on the host Windows OS machine. The minimum requirement to enable Always On on SQL Server 2016 is to create a local single-node (single machine) cluster. No multiple nodes, and therefore no additional SQL Servers, are required. The link can however also support multiple-node cluster configurations as optional, in case you have this type of environment for any SQL Server version (2016-2022).

## Install WSFC module on Windows Server

Run the following PowerShell command as Administrator on Windows Server hosting the SQL Server to install Windows Server Failover Cluster module.

```powershell
# Run as Administrator in PowerShell on Windows Server OS hosting the SQL Server
# This installs WSFC module on the host OS
Install-WindowsFeature -Name Failover-Clustering â€“IncludeManagementTools
```

Alternatively, you can also use Server Manager to install WSFC module using the graphical user interface.

## Create single-node cluster

The next step is to create a cluster on the Windows OS hosting SQL Server. This can be achieved using two methods:
1. Simple PowerShell command -- has certain limitations listed below, or
3. Failover Cluster Manager application -- provides full configuration flexibility.

Both methods are described below.

### Create cluster using PowerShell

The simplest method to create a local single-node cluster is through executing a simple PowerShell command on the Windows Server OS hosting SQL Server. This method has limitations as it is intended for single-server machines not joined in a domain. Creating a cluster using this method won't allow you to administer it using the graphical user interface Failover Cluster Manager.

If you need a quick way to create a single-node cluster on your machine, execute the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
# Run as Administrator in PowerShell on Windows Server OS hosting the SQL Server
# This creates a single-node cluster on the host OS, not joined in the domain
New-Cluster -Name "WSFCluster" -AdministrativeAccessPoint None -Verbose -Force
```

In case you need to remove the cluster in the future, for some reason, this can only be done with PowerShell command `Remove-Cluster`.

If you have successfully created cluster using this method, skip ahead to [Grant permissions in SQL Server for WSFC](managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc.md#grant-permissions-in-sql-server-for-wsfc)

### Create cluster using Failover Cluster Manager application

Alternatively, a more flexible way to create a cluster on the Windows OS hosting the SQL Server is through the graphical user interface, using the Failover Cluster Manager application. Follow these steps:

1. Find out your Windows Server name by executing `hostname` command from the command prompt.
1. Record the output of this command (sample output marked in the image below), or keep this window open as you'll use this name in one of the next steps.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc/managed-instance-link-server-hostname.png" alt-text="Screenshot of finding out Windows Server hostname through the command prompt.":::

1. Open Failover Cluster Manager by pressing Windows key + R on the keyboard, type `%windir%\system32\Cluadmin.msc`, and click OK.

   - Alternatively, Failover Cluster Manager can be accessed by opening Server Manager, selecting Tools in the upper right corner, and then selecting Failover Cluster Manager. 

1. In Windows Cluster manager, click on Create Cluster option.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc/managed-instance-link-cluster-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of accessing the create cluster option.":::

1. On the Before You Begin screen, click Next.
1. On the Select Server screen, enter your Windows Server name (type, or copy-paste the output from the earlier executed `hostname` command),  click Add, and then Next.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc/managed-instance-link-cluster-create-select-servers.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entering Windows Server hostname when creating WSFC.":::

1. On the Validation Warning screen, leave Yes on, click Next.
1. On the Before You Being screen, click Next.
1. On the Testing Options screen, leave Run all tests on, and click Next.
1. On the Confirmation screen, click Next.
1. On the Validation screen, wait for the validation to complete.
1. On the Summary screen, click Finish.

1. On the Access Point for Administering the Cluster screen, type your cluster name, for example `WSFCluster`, and then click Next.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc/managed-instance-link-cluster-create-cluster-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entering the cluster name.":::

1. On the Confirmation screen, click Next.
1. On the Creating New Cluster screen, wait for the creation to complete.
1. On the Summary screen, click Finish.

With the above steps, you've created the local single-node Windows Server Failover Cluster.

## Verification

To verify that single-node WSFC cluster has been created, follow these steps:

1. In the Failover Cluster Manager, click on the cluster name on the left-hand side, and expand it by clicking on the `>` arrow.
   - In case that you've closed and reopened Failover Cluster Manager after its creation, the cluster name might not show up on the left-hand side (see the image below).
1. Click on Connect to Cluster on the right-hand side, choose to connect to `<Cluster on this server...>`, and click OK.
1. Click on Nodes.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc/managed-instance-link-cluster-validate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of validating the WSFC creation.":::

   - You should be able to see the local machine single-node added to this cluster and with the Status being `Up`. This verification confirms the WSFC configuration has been completed successfully. You can now close the Failover Cluster Manager tool.

Next, verify that Always On option can be enabled on SQL Server by following these steps:

1. Open SQL Server Configuration Manager
1. Double-click on SQL Server
1. Click on AlwaysOn High Availability tab

   :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc/managed-instance-link-alwayson-validate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of validating that Always On option is enabled in SQL Server.":::

   - You should be able to see the name of the WSFC you've created, and you should be able to check-on the Enable AlwaysOn Availability Groups should option. This verification confirms the configuration has been completed successfully.

## Grant permissions in SQL Server for WSFC

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Granting permissions in SQL Server 2016 to Windows OS system account is mandatory. These permissions enable the SQL Server to work with Windows Server Failover Cluster. Without these permissions, creating an Availability Group on SQL Server 2016 will fail.

Next, grant permissions on SQL Server to `NT Authority \ System` Windows host OS system account, to enable creation of Availability Groups in SQL Server using WSFC. Execute the following T-SQL script on your SQL Server:

1. Log in to your SQL Server, using a client such is SSMS
2. Execute the following T-SQL script

```sql
-- Run on SQL Server
-- Grant permissions to NT Authority \ System to create AG on this SQL Server
GRANT ALTER ANY AVAILABILITY GROUP TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
GO
GRANT CONNECT SQL TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
GO
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
GO
```

## Next steps

- Continue environment preparation for the link by returning to [enable Always On on your SQL Server](managed-instance-link-preparation.md#enable-availability-groups) section in prepare your environment for a link guide.
- To learn more about configuring multiple-node WSFC (not mandatory, and only optional for the link), see [Create a failover cluster](/windows-server/failover-clustering/create-failover-cluster) guide for Windows Server.
