# Replicate a database by using the link feature in SSMS - Azure SQL Managed Instance

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This article teaches you how to replicate your database from SQL Server to Azure SQL Managed Instance by using [the link feature](managed-instance-link-feature-overview.md) in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  

> [!NOTE]
> The link is a feature of Azure SQL Managed Instance and is currently in preview. 

## Prerequisites 

To replicate your databases to SQL Managed Instance through the link, you need the following prerequisites: 

- An active Azure subscription. If you don't have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- [Supported version of SQL Server](managed-instance-link-feature-overview.md) with required service update installed.
- Azure SQL Managed Instance. [Get started](instance-create-quickstart.md) if you don't have it. 
- [SQL Server Management Studio v18.11.1 or later](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).
- A properly [prepared environment](managed-instance-link-preparation.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Current version of SSMS supports automated link configuration for SQL Servers 2019 and 2022.
> 
> SQL Server 2016 is not supported with the current SSMS version. Use [replicate database with scripts](managed-instance-link-use-scripts-to-replicate-database.md) instead.

### Set up database recovery and backup

All databases that will be replicated via the link must be in full recovery mode and have at least one full backup. Use SSMS to back up your database. Follow these steps:

1. In SSMS, right-click on a database name on SQL Server
1. Select Tasks, and then click on Backup Up.
1. Ensure Backup type is Full.
1. Ensure Backup-to option has the backup path to a disk with sufficient free storage space available.
1. Click on OK to complete the full backup.

For more information, see [Create a Full Database Backup](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-full-database-backup-sql-server).

## Replicate a database

In the following steps, you use the **Managed Instance link** wizard in SSMS to create the link between SQL Server and SQL Managed Instance. After you create the link, your source database gets a read-only replica copy on your target managed instance. 

> [!NOTE]
> The link supports replication of user databases only. Replication of system databases is not supported. To replicate instance-level objects (stored in master or msdb databases), we recommend that you script them out and run T-SQL scripts on the destination instance.

1. Open SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance. 
1. In Object Explorer, right-click your database, hover over **Azure SQL Managed Instance link**, and select **Replicate database** to open the **New Managed Instance link** wizard. If your SQL Server version isn't supported, this option won't be available on the context menu.

1. On the **Introduction** page of the wizard, select **Next**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database/link-replicate-introduction.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Introduction page of the wizard for creating a new Managed Instance link.":::

1. On the **SQL Server requirements** page, the wizard validates requirements to establish a link to SQL Managed Instance. Select **Next** after all the requirements are validated. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database/link-replicate-sql-server-requirements.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Requirements page for a Managed Instance link.":::

1. On the **Select Databases** page, choose one or more databases that you want to replicate to SQL Managed Instance via the link feature. Then select **Next**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database/link-replicate-select-databases.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Select Databases page.":::

1. On the **Login to Azure and select Managed Instance** page, select **Sign In** to sign in to Microsoft Azure.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database/link-replicate-login-to-azure.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the area for signing in to Azure.":::
    
    - If you are running SSMS on Windows Server, the login screen in some cases might not show up with the error message `Content within this application coming from the website listed below is being blocked by Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.`. This happens when Windows Server blocks web content from rendering due to security settings configuration. In this case, you will need to [turn off Internet Explorer ESC on Windows servers](/troubleshoot/developer/browsers/security-privacy/enhanced-security-configuration-faq#how-to-turn-off-internet-explorer-esc-on-windows-servers).

1. On the **Login to Azure and select Managed Instance** page, choose the subscription, resource group, and target managed instance from the dropdown lists. Select **Login** and provide login details for SQL Managed Instance. After you've provided all necessary information, select **Next**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database/link-replicate-login-to-azure-populated.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the populated page for selecting a managed instance.":::

1. Review the prepopulated values on the **Specify Distributed AG Options** page, and change any that need customization. When you're ready, select **Next**.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database/link-replicate-distributed-ag-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Specify Distributed A G Options page.":::

1. Review the actions on the **Summary** page. Optionally, select **Script** to create a script that you can run at a later time. When you're ready, select **Finish**.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database/link-replicate-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Summary page.":::

1. The **Executing actions** page displays the progress of each action.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database/link-replicate-executing-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the page for executing actions.":::

1. After all steps finish, the **Results** page shows check marks next to the successfully completed actions. You can now close the window.

## View a replicated database

After the link is created, the selected databases are replicated to the managed instance. 

Use Object Explorer on your SQL Server instance to view the **Synchronized** status of the replicated database. Expand **Always On High Availability** and **Availability Groups** to view the distributed availability group that's created for the link.

Connect to your managed instance and use Object Explorer to view your replicated database. Depending on the database size and network speed, the database might initially be in a **Restoring** state. After initial seeding finishes, the database is restored to the managed instance and ready for read-only workloads.
